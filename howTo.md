<strong>how to get the database working:</strong>
1. Import the new database (characterDB.sql) into joecool
2. Download all the new files
3. Next vi into database.php and replace YOURNAME & YOURPASSWORD with ur name and password for joecool(it might be your student id # still)
4. It should work now

<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
(things Ive changed)
1. changed the charCreator.html to a .php because the code wont execute in .html
2. added the name to the database so now you can type your characters name and it will save to DB, (including the update.php and charDB.php pages)
3. styled some shit idk feel free to make it better, im kinda shit at css
4. added the nav bar to all the pages

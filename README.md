# dndCharacterCreator
Website to create and store Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters within a database. Can create a character manually or use the integrated API to generate a character.

## Pages include:
1. <strong>index.html:</strong> landing page to get to others
2. <strong>characterDB.php:</strong> Page to look at, interact with database of character info
3. <strong>charSheet.php:</strong> Page for manual character creation
4. <strong>generateCharacter.php:</strong> Page to submit prompt to DnD API to generate character automatically
5. <strong>generateImage.php:</strong> Page to generate an AI image of an existing character in the database
6. <strong>bugReport.php:</strong> Reporting a bug, simple PHP form

Other ideas:
- Image generation API
- Allow accounts to be made to save character info? I don't know how that would even work though
-

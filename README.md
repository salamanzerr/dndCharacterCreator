# dndCharacterCreator
Website to create and store Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters within a database. Can create a character manually or use the integrated API to generate a character.

## Pages will include:
1. Landing page; home page to get to others
2. Page to look at, interact with database of character info
3. Page for manual character creation
4. Page to submit prompt to DnD API to generate character automatically
5. 

Other ideas:
- Image generation API
- Allow accounts to be made to save character info? I don't know how that would even work though
-
